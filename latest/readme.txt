The fonts, including any derivative works, can be		bundled, embedded, and redistributed provided the terms of this licence		are met. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under		any other licence. The requirement for fonts to remain under this		licence does not require any document created using the fonts or their		derivatives to be published under this licence, as long as the primary		purpose of the document is not to be a vehicle for the distribution of		the fonts.		DEFINITIONS		"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright		Holder(s) under this licence and clearly marked as such. This may		include source files, build scripts and documentation.		"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components		as received under this licence.		"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,		or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the		Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to		a new environment.		"Copyright Holder(s)" refers to all individuals and companies who have a		copyright ownership of the Font Software.		"Substantially Changed" refers to Modified Versions which can be easily		identified as dissimilar to the Font Software by users of the Font		Software comparing the Original Version with the Modified Version.		To "Propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without		permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for		infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a		computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,		distribution (with or without modification and with or without charging		a redistribution fee), making available to the public, and in some		countries other activities as well.		PERMISSION & CONDITIONS		This licence does not grant any rights under trademark law and all such		rights are reserved.		Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a		copy of the Font Software, to propagate the Font Software, subject to		the below conditions:		1) Each copy of the Font Software must contain the above copyright		notice and this licence. These can be included either as stand-alone		text files, human-readable headers or in the appropriate machine-		readable metadata fields within text or binary files as long as those		fields can be easily viewed by the user.		2) The font name complies with the following:		(a) The Original Version must retain its name, unmodified.		(b) Modified Versions which are Substantially Changed must be renamed to		avoid use of the name of the Original Version or similar names entirely.		(c) Modified Versions which are not Substantially Changed must be		renamed to both (i) retain the name of the Original Version and (ii) add		additional naming elements to distinguish the Modified Version from the		Original Version. The name of such Modified Versions must be the name of		the Original Version, with "derivative X" where X represents the name of		the new work, appended to that name.		3) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) and any contributor to the		Font Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any		Modified Version, except (i) as required by this licence, (ii) to		acknowledge the contribution(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or (iii) with		their explicit written permission.		4) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole, must		be distributed entirely under this licence, and must not be distributed		under any other licence. The requirement for fonts to remain under this		licence does not affect any document created using the Font Software,		except any version of the Font Software extracted from a document		created using the Font Software may only be distributed under this		licence.		TERMINATION		This licence becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are		not met.		DISCLAIMER		THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,		EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF		MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF		COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT.
